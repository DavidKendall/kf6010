## Reliability types

### Exercise 1.
You are a software engineering consultant to a team designing a networked
traffic light system for a city centre. The design that is emerging is of a
number of processor nodes controlling the lights in their vicinity, networked
to a "master" control computer. Your role is to advise on reliability issues.

1. The operational requirements of a real-time system can be classified as
   fail-operational, fail- active, fail-safe, and high-availability. Describe
   the characteristics of each of these four categories, and classify the traffic
   light system in one of these categories, giving your reasons.

2. What particular reliability issues arise as a result of the fact that the
   system is distributed?

3. You have been asked by the team leader to explain various options for
   designing the software to be fault-tolerant. Describe each of these
   techniques ...

    *  backward error recovery with recovery blocks
    *  exception handling
    *  N-version programming

4. Consider the strengths and weaknesses of each of these and make a
   recommendation of one for the traffic light system.


### Exercise 2
You are a software engineer in a team designing a control system for a network
of electricity distribution substations. The consensus in the team is that
each substation should have a control processor monitoring and controlling the
plant in the substation, and these should be networked to a central control
computer. Your role is to advise on reliability issues.

1. Should the operational requirements this real-time system be classified as
   fail-operational, fail-active, fail-safe, or high-availability?  
   Define these four categories, and give reasons for your choice.
2. What particular reliability issues arise as a result of the fact that the system is distributed?
3. Briefly describe a protocol which the distributed system can use so that processing nodes always 
agree on the ordering of events.
4. Explain the following fault-tolerant software design techniques and recommend one for the 
control system.

     * backward error recovery with recovery blocks
     * exception handling
     * N-version programming

## Sensors 
The MBED board comes with several sensors built in.  Some important questions,

1. What sensors are there?  
2. What interface does the library provide?
3. What range does the library return?
3. What is it's precision?
4. What real sensed values do these represent?

### ADC
The Analogue-to-Digital-Converters are 10bit devices, they give a range of
0 -- 1024 in steps of 1.   The reference voltage for the ADC is 3,3V, this
means that the value of 1024 corresponds to a voltage of 3.3V and the
resolution corresponds to (3.3/1024) 0.00322265625V.

The Library returns a floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0.  The 1
corresponds to 3.3V

> If you use a `float` are there enough bits in the mantissa to hold all 10
> bits of the ADC value?  Do the resolutions match?

### Accelerometer
1. What values does the accelerometer library return?
2. What 'units' is the value given in?
3. What is the resolution.

## LoRa Shield and Grove sensors
The LoRa shield has sockets to connect Grove sensors.  Grove sensors are
packaged in a particular way making then portable over compatible systems.
( see [Grove System Wiki](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/))

### For each sensor module
1. What sensors are packaged on the module?
2. What does it measure?
3. What interface does it connect to the MBED board by
   * ADC
   * I2C
   * SPI
4. What range and resolution are the values read into the program with?
5. What real world physical values do they correspond to?

For sensors see ([Sensors - Seed
Studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/category/Sensor-for-Grove-c-24.html)),

For example the [Temperature and Humidity
sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/category/Grove-c-1003/category/Sensor-for-Grove-c-24/Grove-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor-DHT11.html)
has a
[datasheet](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Grove_Temperature_and_Humidity_Sensor/raw/master/resources/DHT11.pdf)
that tells you the physical characteristics of the sensor.

## Data Logging
> for now assume we can get the LoRa shields to exchange data,  use the
> locally attached sensors and just pretend the data came over the LoRaWAN
> from another board.

1. Record sets of sensor data from various devices.
2. Convert (if needed) values to real world values.
2. Log the data to a server using MQTT
3. Log the data to the PC via the usb/serial terminal

We can capture some (interesting) data for later analysis, plotting, ...

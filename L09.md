## Introduction 
<p class="lead">
This lab requires you to perform experiments to measure the best, mean
and worst-case execution times for a variety of small pieces code.

## Preliminaries

1. You need to have a terminal emulator that can connect to a serial port
   to allow the results of the measurement experiments to be reported
   conveniently to the user. Ensure that `minicom` is installed, using the
   following command:

   ```sh
   $ sudo apt-get install minicom
   ```
   Open a terminal window and run `minicom` as follows:

   ```sh
   $ minicom -s
   ```
   Configure the serial connection for `/dev/ttyACM0` with the 
   parameters 9600 8N1.

## Exercises

1. Make sure that you are up to date with the exercises so far. When you are
   ready to check your work, you can import the repositories and checkout the
   solution branches. Build, run, and observe the solution programs. Study the
   code carefully to make sure that you understand it. Ask your lab tutor for
   help with anything that you don’t understand.


1. Now import `https://github.com/davidkendall/measure-mbed`. Build and load
   the program. This program is intended to investigate the execution
   time of code that uses the LCD. The software under test is the block of code
   between the comments `Software under test`.  Run the program and
   observe its behaviour. You can re-run the experiment by pressing
   `SW3`. Make sure that you understand the code and how the experiment
   is constructed.

1. The peripheral clock for the counter is running at 60 MHz. The numbers
   shown in the experiment represent the number of ticks of this clock.
   1. What is the resolution of this clock?
   1. The timer counter is a 32 bit register. What is the longest period of
   time that can be measured at this resolution before the timer counter 
   overflows?
   1. Express in milliseconds (to 3 d.p.) the minimum, mean and maximum values
   that you observe for positioning the cursor and writing the string
   `Hello world` to the LCD.

1. Modify this experiment in the following ways:
   1. Comment the line that writes `Hello World` to the LCD, leaving
   just the code that positions the cursor as the 'Software under test'. Re-run
   the experiment. What can you conclude from the results about the
   length of time that it takes to position the cursor? What
   can you conclude about the length of time that it takes to write
   `Hello world` to the LCD without positioning the cursor?
   1. Reduce the length of the original string by a single
   character. Re-run the experiment and note the results. Now increase
   the length of the original string by a single character. Re-run the
   experiment and note the results. What can you say about the length
   of time that it takes to write a single character to the LCD?
   1. Add some code to the 'Software under test' whose execution time
   is guaranteed to be so long that the timer counter will overflow. This will
   cause the PIT interrupt handler to be called, causing an irregular flashing
   pattern to occur on the red LED. Adopt the rough and ready approach of
   using the stopwatch on your phone to measure the time between starting the
   experiment and the timer counter overflowing. Does it match approximately the
   time that you calculated earlier?

1. For each of the devices specified below, perform experiments to 
   measure the best-case, mean-case, and worst-case execution times for
   reading a value from the device. Record your results carefully.
   1. Potentiometer
   1. Joystick
   1. Accelerometer
   1. Thermometer

1. Measure the best-case, mean-case, and worst-case execution time of the
   code to write the string `Hello world` to the serial port. Record your
   result carefully.

1. Devise some experiments of your own to measure the execution times of
   features of interest, e.g.
   1. the effect of using `i++`, `i += 1` and `i = i + 1`
   as the increment mechanism in the control parameters of a `for` loop;
   1. the effect of the number of parameters in calling a function;
   1. the effect of storing data in different types of memory, e.g.
   sum an array of ints stored in RAM (automatic); sum the same array stored in flash (static const).
   
   Use a loop to obtain results for measurements less than the clock resolution
   -- remember to account for the time taken by the loop.  Implement the
   experiments and record the results. Identify the strengths and weaknesses of
   your solutions.

Remember if there's anything you don't understand in the labs, please
ask your tutor for help.

## Working at home
You’ll need to spend about 5 or 6 hours per week, outside of scheduled
classroom time, working on the exercises and doing further reading. The most
important part of this will be the time that you spend programming. You can
configure your own computer to enable you to do any of the work that you would
normally do in the lab. If your own computer has a Linux OS installed, then
you can simply follow the instructions for installing the GNU Arm Embedded
Toolchain and pyOCD. If you have a Windows or Mac machine, then you should
[install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html) and create an Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop guest OS to run on your
machine. See [Using Virtualbox]({{ site.url }}/kf4005/L01.html#using-virtualbox) for guidance. You can then install the tools, as
explained earlier.

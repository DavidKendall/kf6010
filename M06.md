title: Using the FRDM-K64F with Mosquitto and MQTT

## Introduction

This lab is intended to give you some experience of setting up an MQTT broker
(server) and using it to publish messages from a FRDM-K64F board. You will use
the Eclipse Mosquitto server as the MQTT broker and the Eclipse Paho client, 
ported to the mbed environment, as an MQTT client. 

* [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)
* [Eclipse Paho](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/)

## In the lab

1. Ensure the you have the latest `mosquitto` broker installed on your system

     ```sh
     $ sudo apt install mosquitto
     ```
   When the broker has been installed, the package manager starts it 
   automatically. Check that the broker is running.

     ```sh
     $ systemctl status mosquitto
     ```
   You should see output similar to the following:

     ```
           mosquitto.service - LSB: mosquitto MQTT v3.1 message broker
              Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/mosquitto; bad; vendor preset: enabled)
              Active: active (running) since Tue 2019-03-05 12:17:28 GMT; 24s ago
                Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)
              CGroup: /system.slice/mosquitto.service
                      └─31149 /usr/sbin/mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

     Mar 05 12:17:28 C17776104 systemd[1]: Starting LSB: mosquitto MQTT v3.1 message broker...
     Mar 05 12:17:28 C17776104 mosquitto[31137]:  * Starting network daemon: mosquitto
     Mar 05 12:17:28 C17776104 mosquitto[31137]:    ...done.
     Mar 05 12:17:28 C17776104 systemd[1]: Started LSB: mosquitto MQTT v3.1 message broker.
     ```
   By default, your `mosquitto` broker listens on port 1883 for messages.

1. The easiest way to test your `mosquitto` broker is to use the simple
   command-line clients `mosquitto_sub` and `mosquitto_pub` to subscribe and
   publish topics, respectively. You may need to install these programs before
   you can use them.

     ```sh
     $ sudo apt install mosquitto-clients
     ```

   We'll just use `localhost` for now. You can subscribe to a topic using
   `mosquitto_sub`, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t student/messages
     ```
   Now start a new terminal window and publish to the topic `student/messages`
   on `localhost`, e.g.

     ```sh
     mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t student/messages -m "Hello world"
     ```
   You should see `Hello world` appear in the terminal window where you ran
   `mosquitto_sub`.

1. Try publishing some other messages to the same topic, e.g.
   * 3.142
   * true
   * -67

   Now try publishing to a different topic, e.g.
     
     ```sh
     $ mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t student/data -m "Hello world"
     ```
   You should see that this message is not received by your subscriber since
   you haven't subscribed to this topic. Topics in `mqtt` are specified using
   a hierarchical name, similar to file names in a Unix file system hierarchy,
   e.g. `student/messages`, `student/data/potentiometer`, `student/data/acc/x`,
   and so on. You can use two wildcard characters when subscribing:
   * `+` matches any one level in the hierarchy
   * `#` matches all remaining levels (must appear last)

   e.g.

     ```sh
     $ mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t student/#
     ```
   subscribes to all `student` topics. Try it out. Use `man mqtt` for more
   details about topic specifications.

1. Now you're going to use the FRDM-K64F board with the MQTT Paho client library
   ported to mbed to act as a publisher. See [MQTT- mbed](https://os.mbed.com/teams/mqtt/).

   Import the [HelloMQTT example](https://os.mbed.com/teams/mqtt/code/HelloMQTT/).

   ```sh
   $ mbed import https://os.mbed.com/teams/mqtt/code/HelloMQTT/
   ```
   Start a `minicom` session with the parameters `9600 8 N 1`.

   Connect the `mbed` board to the internet with an RJ45 cable (found in the space
   between CIS 201 and CIS 202). Ensure that the desk port that you use is connected to
   an Internet switch in its cabinet.

   Find out the IP address of the PC you are using

   Start a subscriber to all `mbed-sample` topics as follows:

   ```sh
   $ mosquitto_sub -h 

   ```sh
   $ mbed compile -t GCC_ARM -m K64F -f
   ```

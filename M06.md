## Introduction

This lab is intended to give you some experience of setting up an MQTT broker
(server) and using it to publish messages from a FRDM-K64F board. You will use
the Eclipse Mosquitto server as the MQTT broker and the Eclipse Paho client, 
ported to the mbed environment, as an MQTT client. 

* [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)
* [Eclipse Paho](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/)

## In the lab

1. Ensure the you have the latest `mosquitto` broker installed on your system

     ```sh
     $ sudo apt install mosquitto
     ```
   When the broker has been installed, the package manager starts it 
   automatically. Check that the broker is running.

     ```sh
     $ systemctl status mosquitto
     ```
   You should see output similar to the following:

     ```
           mosquitto.service - LSB: mosquitto MQTT v3.1 message broker
              Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/mosquitto; bad; vendor preset: enabled)
              Active: active (running) since Tue 2019-03-05 12:17:28 GMT; 24s ago
                Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)
              CGroup: /system.slice/mosquitto.service
                      └─31149 /usr/sbin/mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

     Mar 05 12:17:28 C17776104 systemd[1]: Starting LSB: mosquitto MQTT v3.1 message broker...
     Mar 05 12:17:28 C17776104 mosquitto[31137]:  * Starting network daemon: mosquitto
     Mar 05 12:17:28 C17776104 mosquitto[31137]:    ...done.
     Mar 05 12:17:28 C17776104 systemd[1]: Started LSB: mosquitto MQTT v3.1 message broker.
     ```
   By default, your `mosquitto` broker listens on port 1883 for messages.

1. The easiest way to test your `mosquitto` broker is to use the simple
   command-line clients `mosquitto_sub` and `mosquitto_pub` to subscribe and
   publish topics, respectively. You may need to install these programs before
   you can use them.

     ```sh
     $ sudo apt install mosquitto-clients
     ```

   We'll just use `localhost` for now. You can subscribe to a topic using
   `mosquitto_sub`, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t student/messages
     ```
   Now start a new terminal window and publish to the topic `student/messages`
   on `localhost`, e.g.

     ```sh
     mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t student/messages -m "Hello world"
     ```
   You should see `Hello world` appear in the terminal window where you ran
   `mosquitto_sub`.

1. Try publishing some other messages to the same topic, e.g.
   * 3.142
   * true
   * -67

   Now try publishing to a different topic, e.g.
     
     ```sh
     $ mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t student/data -m "Hello world"
     ```
   You should see that this message is not received by your subscriber since
   you haven't subscribed to this topic. Topics in `mqtt` are specified using
   a hierarchical name, similar to file names in a Unix file system hierarchy,
   e.g. `student/messages`, `student/data/potentiometer`, `student/data/acc/x`,
   and so on. You can use two wildcard characters when subscribing:
   * `+` matches any one level in the hierarchy
   * `#` matches all remaining levels (must appear last)

   e.g.

     ```sh
     $ mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t student/#
     ```
   subscribes to all `student` topics. Try it out. Use `man mqtt` for more
   details about topic specifications.

1. Now you're going to use the FRDM-K64F board with the MQTT Paho client library
   ported to mbed to act as a publisher. See [MQTT- mbed](https://os.mbed.com/teams/mqtt/).

   Import the [HelloMQTT example](https://os.mbed.com/teams/mqtt/code/HelloMQTT/).

   ```sh
   $ mbed import https://os.mbed.com/teams/mqtt/code/HelloMQTT/
   ```
   Start a `minicom` session with the parameters `9600 8 N 1`.

   Connect the `mbed` board to the internet with an RJ45 cable (found in the space
   between CIS 201 and CIS 202). Ensure that the desk port that you use is connected to
   an Internet switch in its cabinet.

   Find out the IP address of the PC you are using

   ```sh
   $ ip addr
   ```
   Make a note of the address of the Ethernet controller, labelled `inet`, 
   e.g. `192.168.70.7`. Load the `main.cpp` file into an editor and go to
   line 80. Replace the string "m2m.eclipse.org" with a string containing
   your IP address, e.g. "192.168.70.7". Comment out lines 90 and 91 
   (specifying a username and password). Save the program.

   Start a subscriber to all `mbed-sample` topics. Use your own IP address
   as the host address, e.g.

   ```sh
   $ mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.70.7 -t mbed-sample/#
   ```

   Compile your program and flash the board.

   ```sh
   $ mbed compile -t GCC_ARM -m K64F -f
   ```
   If necessary, press the `reset` button on the board to start execution.
   You should see messages in your `minicom` terminal, showing the progress of
   the program. Eventually, you should see that 3 messages have been received
   by your `mosquitto` subscriber and also by the board itself (it subscribes
   to its own messages).

1. Once you are happy that the program is behaving as you expect, study the code
   in `main.cpp` carefully to understand how topics are being published,
   subscribed, and received. Now modify the program so that it publishes
   a selection of its sensor data periodically (say every 5 seconds - you can
   experiment with this value). Design your own hierarchical naming scheme
   for the sensor data (use the FRDM-K64F with the application board attached
   to give a variety of sensor data). Build and run your program. Ensure that
   the sensor data can be received by subscribers.

1. Now design a naming scheme for control data so that a `mosquitto` publisher
   can issue commands to a particular board to control its RGB led. Modify
   your program to receive these commands and perform the necessary control
   action.

1. Working with a partner, connect 2 FRDM-K64F boards using CAN. Connect
   one of the boards to the Internet and periodically publish sensor data
   from *both* boards. You will need to design a hierarchical naming scheme
   that allows the boards to be identified. Start 2 `mosquitto` subscribers,
   one for the sensor data from each of your boards.

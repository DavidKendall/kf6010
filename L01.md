This lab will introduce you to the hardware and
software needed to use this board. We start with a *minimal* approach, using
the smallest amount of code to get the board to do something useful (flash an
LED!). We introduce a free, open-source compiler, debugger and build system,
and use them to build and run a program to flash the LEDs. Some of the details
in this lab will seem quite complicated. Don't worry! Starting from the next
lab, we'll use some techniques that hide many of these low-level details. 
It's very useful to have an idea of what's going on 'underneath the bonnet' for
those occasions when the high-level tools don't do quite what you expect.

When you have completed this lab, you should know how to 

* Install the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain
* Install the pyOCD tool for debugging
* Use pointers and bit operators in C for low-level system development
* Use the FRDM-K64F documentation to guide your program development
* Develop low-level software for the LEDs on the FRDM-K64F
* Build and run software to flash the LEDs on the FRDM-K64F

## Installation of GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain

1. Download the latest version of the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain for Linux
   from the [downloads](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
   page. Save the file to `~/Downloads`. The latest version at time of writing
   is called [`gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2019-q3-update-linux.tar.bz2`](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/8-2019q3/RC1.1/gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2019-q3-update-linux.tar.bz2?revision=c34d758a-be0c-476e-a2de-af8c6e16a8a2?product=GNU%20Arm%20Embedded%20Toolchain,64-bit,,Linux,8-2019-q3-update)
. You will need to adapt these
   instructions if the name of your version is different.

1. Install the toolchain for the student user in `~/.local/packages` and create
   a soft link called `gcc-arm` to the installation directory.

     ```sh
     $ mkdir -p ~/.local/packages
     $ cd ~/.local/packages
     $ tar jxvf ~/Downloads/gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2019-q3-update-linux.tar.bz2
     $ ln -s gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2019-q3-update gcc-arm
     ```

1. Test the toolchain by downloading and building a 
   [small example program](https://github.com/kf6010/blinky-bare).

	Rather than clone the repository as below, first goto the URL on `github`
    and *fork* the repository into your own github account.  Then you can
	clone that repository, and push you changes back into the repository on
	`github`

     ```sh
     $ cd 
     $ git clone https://github.com/kf6010/blinky-bare.git
     $ cd blinky-bare
     $ make
     ```
   The last 4 lines of output should look something like...

     ```
     ---- RAM/Flash Usage ----
     ~/.local/packages/gcc-arm/bin/arm-none-eabi-size blinky-bare.elf
        text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
        1664     104    2076    3844     f04 blinky-bare.elf
     ```

## Installation of pyOCD for download and debugging

1. Install `pyOCD` as follows

     ```sh
     $ pip install --user -U pyocd
     ```
	or if you have the right priveledges 
	```sh
	$ sudo -H pip install pyocd
	```

1. Plug a USB cable into the FRDM-K64F board. It is important to plug the cable
   into the correct port. This is the USB port immediately below the 
   `mbed Enabled` logo on the application board and right next to the `RESET`
   button on the FRDM-K64F board. If you plug the cable into the wrong port,
   your board will not be powered correctly and will fail to work properly.
   Now plug the other end of the USB cable into a USB port on your computer. 
   Run the command:

     ```sh
     $ pyocd list
     ```
   You should see some output like this,

     ```
     0 => FRDM-K64F [k64f] boardId => 0240000034544e45001e00018aa9002b2011000097969900
     ```
   although the `boardId` will be different.

1. If you didn't get any output at the previous step, that's probably because
   you don't have adequate permissions to add the board to your system. Fix this
   by adding a `udev` rule.

	Download the rule file [50-mbed.rules](/kf6010/50-mbed.rules) and copy it into
`/etc/udev/rules.d`

	```sh
	$ wget http://hesabu.net/kf6010/50-mbed.rules
	$ sudo cp 50-mbed.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
	```
	Restart the UDEV service
	```sh
	$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger
	```

   Then unplug your board, plug it back in again and try the `pyocd list`
   command again.

1. Once your board has been recognised by `pyocd`, you can start a debug server
   like this

	```sh
	$ pyocd gdbserver
	```
   The last few lines of output from this command should look like this

     ```
     INFO:root:CPU core is Cortex-M4
     INFO:root:FPU present
     INFO:root:6 hardware breakpoints, 4 literal comparators
     INFO:root:4 hardware watchpoints
     INFO:root:Telnet: server started on port 4444
     INFO:root:GDB server started at port:3333
     INFO:root:One client connected!
     ```

1. Now open a new terminal window and start the ARM GNU debugger.

     ```sh
     $ ~/.local/packages/gcc-arm/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb
     ```

1. From the debug prompt, execute the following commands to download and start
   your program.

     ```sh
     (gdb) target remote localhost:3333
     (gdb) cd ~/blinky-bare
     (gdb) file blinky-bare.elf
     (gdb) load blinky-bare.elf
     (gdb) continue
     ```
   You should see that the blue LED on the FRDM-K64F is now flashing (A
control-C should stop this and return you to the gdb promot, where you can
`continue` again). If so...  

   CONGRATULATIONS!! You have a working build and debug toolchain for this
   device.

## A closer look at the blinky-bare program

The `blinky-bare` program is a very simple example of a device driver. It
is used to control the blue LED on the FRDM-K64F.

Developing a device driver can be a complicated business. Even for a
device as simple as a LED. You need to look at
industry-standard documentation such as user manuals and
schematics. This can be intimidating.  But don't worry. You are not
expected to understand everything straightaway. The point is to
develop an appreciation of the complexity of the process of device
driver development and sufficient understanding to make progress with
the development of drivers of your own for very simple devices. The
lab will also help to reinforce aspects of C programming that are
essential for understanding embedded implementations.

We'll begin by considering the steps required to develop the driver for
for the blue LED on the FRDM-K64F board.

1. *Identify the hardware features of the microcontroller that are
   used to control the device* <br/> A LED is an *output* device.  It
   is a simple device that is either *on* or *off*. We can guess that
   it is associated with one of the GPIO (General Purpose I/O) pins of
   the `FRDM-K64F`. But which one? We could read the
   [schematic]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/FRDM-K64F-SCH-E4.pdf). Find
   the `BLUE` pin on the schematic of the microcontroller. Notice that
   it is associated with PTB21. That means pin 21 in GPIO
   port&nbsp;B. Actually, the pin is associated with several functions.
   We'll need to make sure that the GPIO function is selected for this pin.

1. *Understand how to control the relevant hardware features from
   software* <br/> So now we need to know how to program the GPIO
   pins. We need to read the [reference manual]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/K64P144M120SF5RM.pdf)
   for the `FRDM-K64F`. Chapter 55, starting on p. 1757, deals with GPIO. A
   careful reading of this chapter shows that we need to achieve several
   tasks to use PTB21 as an output pin to control the blue LED:
   1. Enable the clock to PORT B by configuring the appropriate bit in 
      the System Clock Gating Control Register
   1. Use the pin control register to select  the GPIO function for pin 21
      of PORT B
   1. Set the data direction of pin 21 of PORT B as *output*
   1. Use the data output register of PORT B to control the level at pin 21

The following program accomplishes these tasks.

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

/* Register address and mask definitions for the 
 * System Clock Gating Control Register 5 
 * See reference manual, chapter 12, pp 273ff
 */
#define SIM_SCGC5            (*((volatile uint32_t *)(0x40048038u)))
#define SIM_SCGC5_PORTB_MASK (1u << 10)

/* Register address and mask definitions for the Pin Control Register for
 * pin 21 in PORT B
 * See the reference manual, chapter 10, pp 243ff, and chapter 11, pp 273ff
 */ 
#define PORTB_PCR21          (*((volatile uint32_t *)(0x4004A054u)))
#define PORT_PCR_MUX_MASK    (0x0700u)
#define PORT_PCR_MUX_SHIFT   (8u)

/* Register address and mask definitions for GPIO PORT B 
 * Port Data Direction Register and Port Data Output Register
 * See the reference manual, chapter 55, pp 1757ff
 */ 
#define GPIOB_PDDR           (*((volatile uint32_t *)(0x400FF054u)))
#define GPIOB_PDOR           (*((volatile uint32_t *)(0x400FF040u)))
#define PIN21_MASK           (1u << 21)

void delay(int count);

int main(void)
{
    /* Enable the clock to PORT B */
    SIM_SCGC5 |= SIM_SCGC5_PORTB_MASK;

    /* Select the GPIO function (Alternative 1) for pin 21 of PORT B */
    PORTB_PCR21 &= ~PORT_PCR_MUX_MASK;
    PORTB_PCR21 |= (1u << PORT_PCR_MUX_SHIFT);

    /* Set the data direction for pin 21 of PORT B to output */
    GPIOB_PDDR |= PIN21_MASK;

    while (true) {
        /* Turn on the blue LED */
        GPIOB_PDOR &= ~PIN21_MASK;
        /* Wait for about 1 second */
        delay(1000);
        /* Turn off the blue LED */
        GPIOB_PDOR |= PIN21_MASK; 
        /* Wait for about 1 second */
        delay(1000);
    }
    return 0;
}

void delay(int count) {
    volatile int i = 0;
    for (i = count*1000 ; i !=0; i--) {
        /* skip */
    }
}
```
{: .code}
Notice that the registers that are used to control the FRDM-K64F are
*memory-mapped*, i.e. each register is associated with an address in the memory
of the device. The device is controlled simply by writing values to the
relevant addresses. It is often the case that only a few bits are used for some
specific function. When writing a value to a register, it is important that
only specific bits are changed and that the values of the other bits in the
register remain the same. We use the bit operators of the C programming
language to achieve this.  Read the section on 'Common Bit Manipulation
Techniques' in this [Wikipedia
article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_manipulation) for more information.
  
Ask your tutor to explain this program carefully to you. You need to become
familiar with all of its details.


## Exercises

1. Ensure that you have installed the tools and can build and run the 
   `blinky-bare` program, as described in sections 2 and 3.

1. Now you're going to modify the program so that it also flashes the
   red LED.
   * Refer to the [schematic]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/FRDM-K64F-SCH-E4.pdf)
     and find out which pin controls the red LED.
   * Create a new branch in your repository to work on your modification, e.g.:

       ```sh
       $ cd ~/blinky-bare
       $ git checkout -b Exercise.02
       ```
   * Add the code required to flash the red LED in alternation with the blue
     LED. Refer to the [reference manual]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/K64P144M120SF5RM.pdf)
     for the required addresses. You should need exactly six lines of code. One line for each of the following
     steps:
     1. Define the address of the pin control register for
         the pin.
     1. Define a mask for the pin.
     1. Configure the pin for the red LED as a GPIO pin.
     1. Configure the data direction register for the pin so that it is an
         output pin.
     1. Add a line in the loop to make the pin go HIGH at the same time
        as the pin for blue LED goes low.
     1. Add a line in the loop to make the pin go LOW at the same time as
        the pin for the blue LED goes HIGH.
   * Build, run and observe your program as before.
   * Why is it not necessary to enable the clock in this case?

1. When you're satisfied with your solution to the previous exercise, commit your
   changes to your repository and compare your solution with the one that
   we propose.

     ```sh
     $ git add .                # add changes to the staging area
     $ git commit               # commit changes - you'll be prompted to enter a commit message
	 ```
	 * If you have forked the repository and cloned your copy
		```sh
		$ git push --set-upstream origin Solution.02 
		```
		subsiquent commits only need 
		```sh
		$ git push
		```

   Checkout the sample solution and compare that with yours.
	```sh
     $ git checkout Solution.02         # checkout our solution to exercise 2
     ```
   Notice that you can use `git` to create a new branch whenever you want to
   keep a solution to an exercise without modifying an existing branch. We'll
   assume that you'll do this from now on, without mentioning it explicitly in
   the exercises.

	I'd encourage you to get used to using the add-commit-push cycle when
	using your code, to save checkpoints of good code you are happy with,
	before moving on.

1. Now you have a version that uses several LEDs.  If you have successfully
   identified the other register and pins to use, you can see this is a
   laborious process.  Fortunately there is often a header file for the device
   available.  The branch `less-bare` uses this header, and will be a basis
   for the rest of the solutions below.

1. Now simplify the body of the loop so that you *toggle* the state of
   the LEDs using a compound assignment statement involving
   the XOR operator (`^`). The program should behave as before. You'll need to
   initialise the data output pins before the loop.

   (Solution in branch `Solution.03`)

1. Add code to flash the green LED. Your program should repeatedly cycle
   through the colours, RED, GREEN, BLUE, RED, ...

	(Solution in branch `Solution.04`)

1. Occasionally, the device hardware provides features intended to
   make life easier for the programmer. The GPIO devices on the FRDM-K64F
   fall into this category. In this case the feature that is provided is
   a set of registers that allow the programmer to manipulate the value
   of individual bits in the data output register without having to worry about
   disturbing the value of other bits. These registers are known as the
   **PSOR**, **PCOR**, and **PTOR** registers, for Port **Set** Output Register,
   Port **Clear** Output Register and Port **Toggle** Output Register.
   Writing a 1 into any bit position in
   the SET register causes the corresponding bit in the data output register to
   go HIGH but (and this is the key point) writing a 0 into any bit
   position in the SET register has no effect. So, for example, we can
   set bit 21 in the data output register with a simple assignment statement
   `GPIOB_PSOR = (1UL << 21);` without being concerned that we'll affect
   the value of any other bits in the data output register. Similarly, we can
   cause a bit in the data output register to go LOW by writing a 1 to the
   corresponding bit in the CLEAR register, e.g. `GPIOB_PCOR = (1UL << 21);`
   causes bit 21 in the data output register to go LOW while leaving the other
   bits unchanged (contrast this with the alternative approach `GPIOB_PDOR
   &= ~(1UL << 21);`). Modify your solution to exercise 4 so that the
   program has the same behaviour but uses the TOGGLE register,
   rather than using the XOR (`^`) operator on the data output register, and
   changes the state of both LEDs with a *single* assignment statement.

	(Solution in branch `Solution.05`)

1. Now we'll look at some support provided by the microcontroller manufacturer
   so that we don't have to write all our own register definitions to control
   the device. The support comes in the form of a CMSIS header file that contains 
   all of the register definitions that we need. Checkout the `less_bare` branch
   from the repository, build and run the program.

     ```sh
     $ git checkout less-bare
     $ make
     (gdb) load blinky-bare.elf
     (gdb) continue
     ```
   The program should behave exactly the same as the original program but notice
   that, instead of all of the `#define` directives, the program simply includes
   the CMSIS header file, `MK64F12.h`. We still have a `#define` for `PIN21_MASK`
   but all of the other definitions come from the header file. Load the file
   `MK64F12.h` into an editor and have a look for the definitions. You'll see
   that there are many other definitions as well. This file can save us a great
   deal of work. We'll use it from now on, rather than writing our own definitions.
   Have a look the [CMSIS](https://developer.arm.com/embedded/cmsis) page for an
   overview of CMSIS.

1. We have been using the `make` tool to build our programs. `make` automates
   the process of compiling, linking and creating an executable file from our
   source files. It is one of the oldest and most commonly-used automated build
   tools. Have a look at this [overview of make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
   for a little more detail about the tool. There is an 
   [introduction](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction)
   in the [make manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html),
   which also includes full details about its use. Read the introduction and then
   load the `Makefile` for `blinky-bare` into an editor to see how the program is
   built.

1. When you study the `Makefile`, you'll see that there's more than just 
   `main.c` that contributes to the final executable `blinky-bare.elf`. There are
   also
   * `startup_MK64F12.S` - an assembler file that defines the ISR vector table
   * `system_MK64F12.c` - a C program to initilise the clock system
   * `MK64FN1M0xxx12_flash.ld` - a linker file for piecing together the executable

   Load each of these files into an editor and briefly skim through them to get
   an overview of what each is doing. You don't need to understand all of the
   details. You should just be aiming to develop an understanding of
   the kind of files that are needed to build a complete application for an
   embedded device.

## Working at home

You'll need to spend about 5 or 6 hours per week, outside of scheduled
classroom time, working on the exercises and doing further reading. The most
important part of this will be the time that you spend programming. You can
configure your own computer to enable you to do any of the work that you would
normally do in the lab. If your own computer has a Linux OS installed, then you
can simply follow the instructions for installing the GNU Arm Embedded
Toolchain and pyOCD.  If you have a Windows or Mac machine, then you should
[install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html) and create an
Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop guest OS to run on your machine. See [Using
Virtualbox](http://hesabu.net/kf4005/L01.html#using-virtualbox) for guidance.
You can then install the tools, as explained earlier.

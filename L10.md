## Introduction 
<p class="lead">
This lab requires you to perform experiments to measure the worst-case 
execution times for code in a set of uC/OS-II tasks. The tasks have
been allocated priorities in accordance with the rate monotonic principle.
When you have measured the worst-case execution times for all tasks, you 
should use response time analysis to determine whether or not the task set
is schedulable.

## Preliminaries

1. You need to have a terminal emulator that can connect to a serial port
   to allow the results of the measurement experiments to be reported
   conveniently to the user. Ensure that `minicom` is installed, using the
   following command:

   ```sh
   $ sudo apt-get install minicom
   ```
   Open a terminal window and run `minicom` as follows:

   ```sh
   $ minicom -s
   ```
   Configure the serial connection for `/dev/ttyACM0` with the 
   parameters 9600 8N1.

   From the `minicom` terminal, type `Ctrl-A U` to turn on the addition of
   carriage returns following end of line.

## Exercises

1. Make sure that you are up to date with the exercises so far. When you are
   ready to check your work, you can import the repositories and checkout the
   solution branches. Build, run, and observe the solution programs. Study the
   code carefully to make sure that you understand it. Ask your lab tutor for
   help with anything that you don’t understand.


1. Now import `https://github.com/davidkendall/measure-analysis-mbed`. Build and load
   the program. Notice that it appears to run satisfactorily. Study the source
   code in `src/app/main.cpp`. You will see that the program comprises
   5 tasks: checking if SW3 is pressed, sampling the accelerometer, updating
   the LCD, updating the speaker, and flashing the red LED. 

1. Take the main body of each task and copy it into the measurement program
   that you have already used so that it forms the 'Software under test'. Run
   the measurement program to obtain an estimate of the worst-case execution
   time of the code. For example, for the task `sampleAccel` you would use

   ```c
    accelVal[0] = accel.x();
    accelVal[1] = accel.y();
    accelVal[2] = accel.z();
   ```
   as the 'Software under test'. You may need to add additional variables to
   your program in order to build it. Obtain the worst-case execution time.
   You can assume that the period of the task is given by the `OSTimeDlyHMSM()`
   call, in this case it is 100 ms. Why is it necessary to use a separate 
   program to measure the worst-case execution time of each code fragment
   individually?

1. When you have recorded the worst-case execution time and the period for
   each task, use response time analysis to determine whether or not the
   task set is schedulable. **Note:** If you need a refresher on response time
   analysis, have a look at the slides and the lab session for week 5.

Remember if there's anything you don't understand in the labs, please
ask your tutor for help.

## Working at home
You’ll need to spend about 5 or 6 hours per week, outside of scheduled
classroom time, working on the exercises and doing further reading. The most
important part of this will be the time that you spend programming. You can
configure your own computer to enable you to do any of the work that you would
normally do in the lab. If your own computer has a Linux OS installed, then
you can simply follow the instructions for installing the GNU Arm Embedded
Toolchain and pyOCD. If you have a Windows or Mac machine, then you should
[install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html) and create an Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop guest OS to run on your
machine. See [Using Virtualbox](http://hesabu.net/kf4005/L01.html#using-virtualbox) for guidance. You can then install the tools, as
explained earlier.

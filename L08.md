# Introduction 
<p class="lead">
This lab requires you to build a program for the application board using the
MBED RTOS.

The MBED RTOS provides deterministic, multithreaded, real-time software
execution. The RTOS primitives are always available, allowing
applications to rely on threads, semaphores, mutexes and other RTOS features.

# Exercises
Make sure that you are up to date with the exercises so far. When you are
ready to check your work, you can import the repositories and checkout the
solution branches. Build, run, and observe the solution programs. Study the
code carefully to make sure that you understand it. Ask your lab tutor for
help with anything that you don’t understand.

__Aside on firmware__
On my board I've updated to the latest DAPLink firmware, this means that the `mbed`
tools can reset the board once it has been programmed with `mbed compile --flash`

For instructions on how to check what version of the firmware you have see the
blog article [DAPLink bootloader update](https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/DAPLink-bootloader-update/) particularly the
[flowchart](https://os.mbed.com/media/uploads/sam_grove/flowchart_3.png)

## Threads
The MBED RTOS supplies threads in a form similar to the POSIX threads you will
have seen before.   There is implicitly one thread in every program, the thread
in which `main` runs.

```sh
$ mbed import https://github.com/dr-alun-moon/blinky-mbed-rtos
$ cd blinky-mbed-rtos
```

1. Add threads to flash the other LEDs. 
1. Experiment with using delays and mark-space times in the threads.  
   Can you get the red, green, and blue LEDs to alternate?

```c 
void flash_green(void)
{
    wait(0.3);
    while(true) {
        green = ON;
        wait(0.3);
        green = OFF;
        wait(0.6);
    }
}
```
_Question_?  Why in `main` is there no `while` loop?   What is the effect of
calling `blink1.join()`?

## Semaphores
The OS provides semaphores with `wait` and `release` operations (_cf_.
POSIX
`sem_pend` and `sem_post` from [KF5010](http://hesabu.net/kf5010/))

### Wait for signal
Import and run the example

```sh
$ mbed import https://github.com/dr-alun-moon/blinky-mbed-semaphore
$ cd blinky-mbed-semaphore
```

Examine the code and identify the following points:
1. What stops the thread writing to the LCD from running continuously?
2. If data is available from both potentiometers does the program handle this
   condition?  
   (You may want to check the definition of semaphore function to satisfy
yourself there is no failure mode).
3. The red LED should be on while the LCD is updated, how long does this write
   take?  You may not be able to measure it exactly but you should see that it
is a significant amount of time.

__Add code__ to handle the second potentiometer.

__How would you__ add code to handle the other sensors?

__*What would happen*__ if you changed the sense of the semaphore?  If the LCD
was treated as a critical resource and the sensor threads had to wait for it
to be available?


### Limited Resource
Import and run the example
```sh
$ mbed import https://github.com/dr-alun-moon/blinky-mbed-semaphore-alt
$ cd blinky-mbed-semaphore-alt
```

1. Observe the behaviour of the LEDs.
2. Uncomment the lines including the semaphore `flag`.  
   Rerun the program, what is the behaviour of the LEDs?  Why?
3. Change the initial value of the semaphore to 1.
   ```c
	Semaphore flag(1);
   ```
   Rerun the program, what is the behaviour of the LEDs?  Why?
4. Try with an initial semaphore value of 2.  What is the behaviour now?

__Add code__ to include the application shield LEDs on pins `D5`, `D8`, and `D9`.  
Is the behaviour clear?

Can you explain the behaviours from your knowledge of Semaphores?

## Events
Some code will want to be run in response to an event, either internal or external.
The MBED RTOS provides an event handling mechanism to trigger and handle events.

_One common case where this is needed is in handling interrupts._
Some API functions (waiting on a semaphore) are not allowed in the ISR (Interrupt Service Routine).
Other long duration operations, such as LCD updates, are not recommended to be used in ISRs.

Import and build the example
```sh
$ mbed import https://github.com/dr-alun-moon/blinky-mbed-events
$ cd blinky-mbed-events
```

Examine the code, the button push generates an interrupt that is processes by the ISR registered in 
`fall`.   The `EventQueue` has a method that generates a function suitable for the ISR that triggers an event.
The event handler is processed in the thread running the event queue, in this case the thread for `main`.


1.  Add an event to the second button `SW3` that resets the counter.  
   (You may have to make the counter a global variable to do so)

# Application
Once you have a system that flashes the LEDs, develop it further to the point
where it implements all of the application board requirements from week 3.
Structure your application so that there is a separate task for each device.

You will need to add libraries to
your project for the LCD, and the accelerometer and temperature sensors. Refer
to the week 3 lab notes if you need a reminder of how to do this.


# Working at home
You’ll need to spend about 5 or 6 hours per week, outside of scheduled
classroom time, working on the exercises and doing further reading. The most
important part of this will be the time that you spend programming. You can
configure your own computer to enable you to do any of the work that you would
normally do in the lab. If your own computer has a Linux OS installed, then
you can simply follow the instructions for installing the GNU Arm Embedded
Toolchain and pyOCD. If you have a Windows or Mac machine, then you should
[install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html) and create an Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop guest OS to run on your
machine. See [Using Virtualbox](http://hesabu.net/kf4005/L01.html#using-virtualbox) for guidance. You can then install the tools, as
explained earlier.

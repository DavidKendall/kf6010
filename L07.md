## Introduction

<p class="lead">
This lab requires you to make use of semaphores in uC/OS-II to solve a variety of
synchronisation problems.

## Exercises

1. Make sure that you are up to date with the exercises so far. When you are 
   ready to check your work, you can import the repositories and checkout the 
   solution branches. Build, run, and observe the solution programs. Study the
   code carefully to make sure that you understand it. Ask your lab tutor for
   help with anything that you don't understand.

   ```sh
   $ cd ~/kf6010
   $ mbed import https://github.com/davidkendall/blinky-mbed-tt
   $ cd blinky-mbed-tt
   $ git checkout P03
   ```
   and

   ```sh
   $ cd ~/kf6010
   $ mbed import https://github.com/davidkendall/blinky-mbed-ucos-ii
   $ git checkout P03
   ```

1. Now import the repository that is the starting point for your use of
   semaphores with uC/OS-II.

   ```sh
   $ cd ~/kf6010
   $ mbed import https://github.com/davidkendall/semaphore-mbed-ucos-ii
   $ cd semaphore-mbed-ucos-ii
   ```
   Build and run the program. Observe its behaviour carefully. Notice that
   the values of the `count1` and `count2` variables are shown on the LCD
   display. The LED on the FRDM-K64F board is green and is not flashing
   (you can ignore the RGB LED on the application board for the moment).

1. Look carefully at the code in `src/app/main.cpp`. Notice the use
   of semaphores in `appTaskCount1` and `appTaskCount2`. Now comment out
   the lines in these tasks that pend and post the `lcdSem`. You should comment
   out 4 lines in total. Build and run the program again. Ignore the warnings
   about unused variables. Observe its behaviour. What happens and why?
   
1. Restore the lines that make use of the `lcdSem`. Build and run the program
   again. Observe its behaviour once more. Notice that the value of the `count1`
   variable is incrementing much more quickly than the value of the `count2`
   variable. How can that be happening? It is possible to replace the `lcdSem`
   with a pair of semaphores, `lcdSem1` and `lcdSem2`, that can be used
   by `appTaskCount1` and `appTaskCount2` to preserve mutual exclusion *and*
   to ensure that both tasks make progress at the same rate. The `appTaskCount1`
   task should pend on `lcdSem1` and post `lcdSem2`. The `apptaskCount2` task
   should pend on `lcdSem2` and post `lcdSem1`. Create these semaphores
   (how should they be initialised to preserve mutual exclusion and avoid
   deadlock?) and implement the functionality described above. Build and
   run the program again. Both counts should now increment at the same rate.

1. Study the initialisation of the semaphores in the previous exercise
   methodically. Try the following combinations of initialisation values:

   ```
          lcdSem1    lcdSem2
          ------------------
              0         0
              0         1
              1         0
              1         1
   ```
   In each case, build and run the program. Observe its behaviour and explain
   the results.

   Now add a 1 ms delay at the beginning of `appTaskCount1`, just 
   immediately before the `while` loop. Try all of the combinations
   of initialisation value again. Build and run the program each time.
   Observe its behaviour and explain the results again.

1. Do the task priorities of this system conform to the requirements of the
   rate monotonic (RM) scheduling method for fixed priority allocation? If so,
   explain why. If not, rewrite the program to comply with RM requirements.
   Build and run your new program.

## Working at home

You'll need to spend about 5 or 6 hours per week, outside of scheduled
classroom time, working on the exercises and doing further reading. The most
important part of this will be the time that you spend programming. You can
configure your own computer to enable you to do any of the work that you would
normally do in the lab. If your own computer has a Linux OS installed, then you
can simply follow the instructions for installing the GNU Arm Embedded
Toolchain and pyOCD.  If you have a Windows or Mac machine, then you should
[install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html) and create an
Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop guest OS to run on your machine. See [Using
Virtualbox]({{ url }}{{ baseurl }}kf4005/L01.html#using-virtualbox) for guidance.
You can then install the tools, as explained earlier.

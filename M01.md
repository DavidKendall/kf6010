## Introduction

This lab runs for 2 weeks and covers the use of the mbed serial communication
libraries for both blocking and non-blocking I/O.

You may find it helpful to refer to the mbed documentation for
* [Serial](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/mbed-os-api-doxy/classmbed_1_1_serial.html)
* [RawSerial](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v5.11/mbed-os-api-doxy/classmbed_1_1_raw_serial.html)
* [UARTSerial](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/mbed-os-api-doxy/classmbed_1_1_u_a_r_t_serial.html)

You will need to work with a partner in the labs to complete these exercises.
Each partner should connect their FRDM-K64F to a PC, as usual. Place your
boards close enough to to each other so that you can connect them using 2
male-male jumper wires. You'll need to remove the application shield from the
FRDM-K64F base board in order to connect the jumper wires. You should do this
as gently as possible, ensuring that the application board is removed evenly.
You will use `UART3` for communicating using the FRDM-K64F boards. See
[FRDM-K64F](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/FRDM-K64F/) for the pinouts.  You
should connect the boards as follows:

* Board 1 RX-TX Board 2
* Board 1 TX-RX Board 2

## Blocking Serial I/O

1. You should begin by working with a simple client/server example.
   One partner will build the server code:

     ```sh
     $ mbed import https://github.com/davidkendall/serial-server
     $ cd serial-server
     $ mbed compile -t GCC_ARM -m K64F
     ```
   The other partner will build the client code:

     ```sh
     $ mbed import https://github.com/davidkendall/serial-client
     $ cd serial-client
     $ mbed compile -t GCC_ARM -m K64F
     ```
   Open a terminal window on each PC and start a `minicom` session, so that
   your board can communicate with your PC. Set the minicom parameters to
   `115200 8N1`. Now load and run the server program. Next load and run the
   client program. You should see some output in your `minicom` terminal
   indicating that the boards are communicating. If not, ask your lab tutor for
   help.

1. Once you have your boards communicating successfully, try changing the baud
   rate of `RawSerial client` to 9600. Build, load and run your programs again.
   What happens? Explain your observation. Change your `RawSerial client` back
   to 115200. Check that everything works again.

1. Modify your programs to use `UARTSerial` instead of `RawSerial`. Use `write`
   for output (instead of `putc`) and `read` for input (instead of `getc`).
   Pay careful attention to the semantics of `write` and `read` (read the
   documentation carefully). You'll need to be particularly careful with
   `read`. Build, load and run your new programs. The behaviour should appear
   to be the same as before.

1. Try to develop a protocol that makes it possible to start the client 
   program before the server program and still allow the exchange of data,
   as usual. This requires some thought. Focus on the client program.

1. Use the technique shown in the lab in week 9 of semester 1 to measure
   the time taken by the client to receive a complete message from the server.
   Apply this technique to the original program and to the program that
   uses `UARTSerial`. What conclusions do you draw from the results? 
   Given the bit rate of the UART and the length of a message, how long
   would you expect it to take to receive a message? How does this compare 
   with the value that you have measured? Can you explain the data?

1. Write a client program that waits for the user to press either SW2 or
   SW3 and then sends a request message to the server. If SW2 is pressed,
   the client should request the server to send its accelerometer data; if
   SW3 is pressed, the client should request the magnetometer data. The
   server should respond appropriately in each case, and the client should
   display the result on its minicom terminal.

## Non-blocking Serial I/O

1. Modify the original client and server programs to use asynchronous
   read for receiving data.

1. Modify your client program that can be safely started before the server
   to use asynchronous read for receiving data. This exercise should
   illustrate the benefits of asynchronous I/O. What do you think is the
   main benefit?

1. Modify your solution for 2.6 to use asynchronous reads.

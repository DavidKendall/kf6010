## Introduction

This lab is intended to help you to develop your understanding of the use
of interrupts, interrupt handlers and the Periodic Timer Interrupt module with
the FRDM-K64F.

## An example program

The `pit-bare` program is a very simple example of using the PIT to generate
an interrupt periodically and installing a handler to take some action when
the interrupt is raised.

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include "MK64F12.h"

#define PIN21_MASK           (1u << 21)

void blue_init(void);
void blue_toggle(void);
void PIT_init(void);
void PIT0_IRQHandler(void);

int main(void)
{
    blue_init();
    PIT_init();
    while (true) {
    }
    /* Should not reach this point */
    return 0;
}

void blue_init(void) {
    /* Enable the clock to PORT B */
    SIM_SCGC5 |= SIM_SCGC5_PORTB_MASK;

    /* Select the GPIO function (Alternative 1) for pin 21 of PORT B */
    PORTB_PCR21 &= ~PORT_PCR_MUX_MASK;
    PORTB_PCR21 |= (1u << PORT_PCR_MUX_SHIFT);

    /* Set the data direction for pin 21 of PORT B to output */
    GPIOB_PDDR |= PIN21_MASK;

    /* LED off initially */
    GPIOB_PDOR |= PIN21_MASK;
}

void blue_toggle(void) {
    /* Blue LED, ON <- OFF, OFF <- ON */
    GPIOB_PDOR ^= PIN21_MASK; 
}

void PIT_init(void) {
    /* Open the clock gate to the PIT */
    SIM_SCGC6 |= (1u << 23);
    /* Enable the clock for the PIT timers. Continue to run in debug mode */
    PIT_MCR_REG(PIT) = 0u;
    /* Period p = 0.5 s, bus clock f = 60 MHz, v = pf - 1 */ 
    PIT_LDVAL_REG(PIT, 0) = 29999999;
    /* Enable interrupt on timeout */
    PIT_TCTRL_REG(PIT, 0) |= PIT_TCTRL_TIE_MASK;
    /* Enable the interrupt in the NVIC */
    NVIC_EnableIRQ(PIT0_IRQn);
    /* Start the timer running */
    PIT_TCTRL_REG(PIT, 0) |= PIT_TCTRL_TEN_MASK;
}

void PIT0_IRQHandler(void) {
    /* Call the main handler function */
    blue_toggle();
    /* Clear the timer interrupt flag to allow further timer interrupts */
    PIT_TFLG_REG(PIT,0) |= PIT_TFLG_TIF_MASK;
}
```

Ask your tutor to explain this program carefully to you. You need to become
familiar with all of its details.


## Exercises

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/davidkendall/pit-bare). Build 
   and run the program in the usual way. 

1. Look in `startup_MKF64F12.S` for the CMSIS definitions for the PIT that are 
   used in the example program. Make sure that you understand them. Ask your lab
   tutor for help, if needed.

1. Write a program that uses PIT channel 1 to raise an interrupt every 
   1/5 seconds and toggles the red LED in its interrupt handler.

1. Write a program that uses PIT channel 2 to raise an interrupt every 
   1/3 seconds and toggles the green LED in its interrupt handler.

1. Write a program that uses switch `SW2` to generate an interrupt whenever 
   it is pressed. Use this switch to control whether the LEDs are flashing or
   not - use it like a toggle, i.e. press `SW2` to start the lights flashing,
   press it again to stop the flashing.

1. What happens to your program if you forget to enable the interrupt in the
   NVIC - comment out the line in the example that does this and try it out. Do
   the same for the line that clears the interrupt flag in `PIT_TFLGn`.

1. **Advanced** What is the longest period between interrupts that can be
   created using a 32 bit timer with a bus clock running at 60 MHz? Chain two
   timers together to allow the use of a longer period.

## Working at home

You'll need to spend about 5 or 6 hours per week, outside of scheduled
classroom time, working on the exercises and doing further reading. The most
important part of this will be the time that you spend programming. You can
configure your own computer to enable you to do any of the work that you would
normally do in the lab. If your own computer has a Linux OS installed, then you
can simply follow the instructions for installing the GNU Arm Embedded
Toolchain and pyOCD.  If you have a Windows or Mac machine, then you should
[install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html) and create an
Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop guest OS to run on your machine. See [Using
Virtualbox](http://hesabu.net/kf4005/L01.html#using-virtualbox) for guidance.
You can then install the tools, as explained earlier.

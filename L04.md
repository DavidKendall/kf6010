## Introduction

<p class="lead">
This lab encourages you to develop your own time-triggered scheduler and to use
it to develop a more responsive application than the one that you developed 
last week with a super-loop approach.

## Exercises

1. Make sure that you are up to date with the exercises so far. When you are 
   ready to check your work, you can import the repositories and checkout the 
   solution branches. Build, run, and observe the solution programs. Study the
   code carefully to make sure that you understand it. Ask your lab tutor for
   help with anything that you don't understand.

   ```sh
   $ cd ~/kf6010
   $ git clone https://github.com/kf6010/pit-bare
   $ cd pit-bare
   $ git checkout Solution.05
   ```
   and

   ```sh
   $ cd ~/kf6010
   $ mbed import https://github.com/kf6010/blinky-mbed
   $ cd blinky-mbed
   $ git checkout Solution.05
   ```

1. Now import the repository that is the starting point for your development of
   a time-triggered scheduler.

   ```sh
   $ cd ~/kf6010
   $ mbed import https://github.com/kf6010/blinky-mbed-tt
   $ cd blinky-mbed-tt
   ```
   Notice that the code is organised in `src/TTsched` and `src/app`
   directories. You will need to modify `src/TTsched/scheduler.c`,
   `src/app/ttSchedConfig.h`, and `src/app/main.cpp`. These files contain
   comments that indicate the work that needs to be done. Pay careful attemtion
   to them. Use the [week 4 lecture
   slides]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/A04.pdf) to guide your development.
   Develop your system to a point where the red LED on the K64F board is
   toggled every 0.5 s, the red LED on the application board is turned off, and
   the green LED on the application board flashes at the same rate as the red
   LED on the K64F board, but is off when the red LED is on, and vice versa.
   Your system should be controlled by the time-triggered scheduler that you
   have developed.

1. Once you have a time-triggered system that flashes the LEDs, develop it
   further to the point where it implements all of the application board
   requirements from [week 3](L03.html). Choose `TT_SCHED_TICK_HZ` and the
   delays and periods for your tasks to give the most responsive system
   that you can manage. You will need to add libraries to your project
   for the LCD, and the accelerometer and temperature sensors. Refer to
   the week 3 lab notes if you need a reminder of how to do this.

## Working at home

You'll need to spend about 5 or 6 hours per week, outside of scheduled
classroom time, working on the exercises and doing further reading. The most
important part of this will be the time that you spend programming. You can
configure your own computer to enable you to do any of the work that you would
normally do in the lab. If your own computer has a Linux OS installed, then you
can simply follow the instructions for installing the GNU Arm Embedded
Toolchain and pyOCD.  If you have a Windows or Mac machine, then you should
[install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html) and create an
Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop guest OS to run on your machine. See [Using
Virtualbox](http://hesabu.net/kf4005/L01.html#using-virtualbox) for guidance.
You can then install the tools, as explained earlier.

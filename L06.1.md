## Introduction
This lab introduces a number of applications that are special cases that can
use a Time-Triggered-Architecture.

1. Morse Code
: This can be represented as a pattern of 0 and 1's, the ITU defines the dots,
  dashes, and gaps; in terms of a time-unit.
1. Navigation Marks
: Maritime navigation marks make use of a wide range of flashing lights, in a
  variety of frequencies and patterns
1. Music
: Musical notes are integer multiples, or integer fractions of a base note,
  the rate and duration of the base time is given as the Time-signature.

## Exercises
### Catch up
Mark sure you are up-to-date with the programming exercises and understand how
the suggested solutions work.

The three examples below are interesting examples of uses of a TTA like
structure.  Have a go at at least one of these...

### Morse Code
The Wikipedia page for Morse Code gives a good summary of the 
[ITU recommended timings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code#Representation,_timing,_and_speeds) 
for Morse, and an example of this representation in 0s and 1s.

The strategy for generating morse is:
1. Take the input string message.
1. Convert this into dots, dashes and spaces.
1. Convert this into the binary representation.
1. Emit the sequence as flashes from an led.

The first steps are essentially string operations, scan the input string,
look-up the output string and concatenate these together.  

* The final string can be quite long, make sure you have a buffer long enough.
* The task will look down the final string and turn an LED on or off as
   appropriate.

Assuming you have populated the array `onoff` the code for the task will be
something like.

```c
void morseblink(void)
{
	static char *s = onoff;
	switch(*s++){
		case '0':
			red = 1;
			break;
		case '1':
			red = 0;
			break;
		case '\0':
			s = onoff;
			break;
	}
}
```

## Working at home

You'll need to spend about 5 or 6 hours per week, outside of scheduled
classroom time, working on the exercises and doing further reading. The most
important part of this will be the time that you spend programming. You can
configure your own computer to enable you to do any of the work that you would
normally do in the lab. If your own computer has a Linux OS installed, then you
can simply follow the instructions for installing the GNU Arm Embedded
Toolchain and pyOCD.  If you have a Windows or Mac machine, then you should
[install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html) and create an
Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop guest OS to run on your machine. See [Using
Virtualbox](http://hesabu.net/kf4005/L01.html#using-virtualbox) for guidance.
You can then install the tools, as explained earlier.

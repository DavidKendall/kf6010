## Introduction

<p class="lead">
This lab gives you the opportunity to practice the scheduling analysis techniques
that have been introduced in the last 2 to 3 weeks.

## Exercises

1. Make sure that you are up to date with the exercises so far. When you are 
   ready to check your work, you can import the repositories and checkout the 
   solution branches. Build, run, and observe the solution programs. Study the
   code carefully to make sure that you understand it. Ask your lab tutor for
   help with anything that you don't understand.

   ```sh
   $ cd ~/kf6010
   $ git clone https://github.com/davidkendall/pit-bare
   $ cd pit-bare
   $ git checkout P05
   ```
   and

   ```sh
   $ cd ~/kf6010
   $ mbed import https://github.com/davidkendall/blinky-mbed
   $ cd blinky-mbed
   $ git checkout P05
   ```
   and 
   
   ```sh
   $ cd ~/kf6010
   $ git clone https://github.com/davidkendall/blinky-mbed-tt
   $ cd blinky-mbed-tt
   $ git checkout P03
   ```

1. Recall the formula for calculating the worst case response time (WCRT),
   $$R_i$$ of a task $$i$$ in a system scheduled using the rate monotonic
   scheme:

   \\[R_i = C_i + \sum_{j \in hp(i)} \left\lceil \frac{R_i}{T_j} \right\rceil C_j\\]

   This equation is solved by establishing a recurrence relation

   \\[w_i^{n+1} = C_i + \sum_{j \in hp(i)} \left\lceil \frac{w_i^{n}}{T_j} \right\rceil C_j\\]
   Set $$w_i^0$$ to $$C_i$$ and then use the relationship above to calculate
   $$w_i^1, w_i^2, w_i^3$$, ... until the sequence converges, i.e. until 
   $$w_i^{k+1} = w_i^k$$, for some number $$k$$.
   
   We can apply this approach to the example in the [lecture]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/A05.pdf)   

   | Task  | Period, T    | Computation time, C    | Priority, P |
   | :---: | :----------: | :--------------------: | :---------: |
      a    |     7        |     3                  |   3
      b    |    12        |     3                  |   2
      c    |    20        |     5                  |   1

   \\[R_a = 3\\]

   \\[w_b^0 = 3\\]
   \\[w_b^1 = 3 + \left\lceil \frac{3}{7} \right\rceil 3 = 6\\]
   \\[w_b^2 = 3 + \left\lceil \frac{6}{7} \right\rceil 3 = 6\\]
   \\[R_b = 6\\]

   \\[w_c^0 = 5\\]
   \\[w_c^1 = 5 + \left\lceil \frac{5}{7} \right\rceil 3 + \left\lceil \frac{5}{12} \right\rceil 3 = 11\\]
   \\[w_c^2 = 5 + \left\lceil \frac{11}{7} \right\rceil 3 + \left\lceil \frac{11}{12} \right\rceil 3 = 14\\]
   \\[w_c^3 = 5 + \left\lceil \frac{14}{7} \right\rceil 3 + \left\lceil \frac{14}{12} \right\rceil 3 = 17\\]
   \\[w_c^4 = 5 + \left\lceil \frac{17}{7} \right\rceil 3 + \left\lceil \frac{17}{12} \right\rceil 3 = 20\\]
   \\[w_c^5 = 5 + \left\lceil \frac{20}{7} \right\rceil 3 + \left\lceil \frac{20}{12} \right\rceil 3 = 20\\]
   \\[R_c = 20\\]

   Since $$R_i \leq T_i$$ for all $$i$$ above, we can see that this task set is schedulable

1. Calculate the utilisation, $$U$$, of the task set above. Apply the necessary and
   sufficient utilisation-based schedulability tests, discussed in the lecture.
   What can you say about the schedulability of the task set, based on those tests?

1. Consider the task set in the table below. 

   | Task  | Period, T    | Computation time, C    |
   | :---: | :----------: | :--------------------: |
      P    |    6         |     2                  |
      Q    |    3         |     1                  |
      R    |    18        |     5                  |

   What priorities should be assigned to these tasks using the rate monotonic
   scheme? Calculate the utilisation of the task set. What can be said
   about its schedulability using the necessary and sufficient
   utilisation-based schedulability tests for RMS? Calculate the response
   time of each task. Is the task set schedulable? Show your working
   in full throughout.

1. Calculate the scheduling table for the task set below using a static
   scheduling approach. What is the hyperperiod? What is a suitable frame
   size? Complete the scheduling table in full for a complete hyperperiod.

   | Task  | Period, T    | Computation time, C    |
   | :---: | :----------: | :--------------------: |
      a    |    25        |    10                  |
      b    |    25        |     8                  |
      c    |    50        |     5                  |
      d    |    50        |     4                  |
      e    |   100        |     2                  |

   Compare the advantages and disadvantages of RMS and static
   scheduling.

## Working at home

You'll need to spend about 5 or 6 hours per week, outside of scheduled
classroom time, working on the exercises and doing further reading. The most
important part of this will be the time that you spend programming. You can
configure your own computer to enable you to do any of the work that you would
normally do in the lab. If your own computer has a Linux OS installed, then you
can simply follow the instructions for installing the GNU Arm Embedded
Toolchain and pyOCD.  If you have a Windows or Mac machine, then you should
[install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html) and create an
Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop guest OS to run on your machine. See [Using
Virtualbox]({{ site.url }}/kf4005/L01.html#using-virtualbox) for guidance.
You can then install the tools, as explained earlier.

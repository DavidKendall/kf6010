## Introduction

<p class="lead">
This lab provides an opportunity to work with the Arm Mbed SDK and the FRDM-K64F
<a href="https://os.mbed.com/components/mbed-Application-Shield/">application
shield</a>. 
</p>

The Arm Mbed SDK was developed as a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and set of
drivers for a wide variety of [embedded systems boards](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/)
based on Arm Cortex-M microcontrollers. The SDK makes it easier for developers
to produce a working system and to reuse their software on different platforms.

## Installing `mbed-cli`

The most efficient way to manage your development with `mbed` is to use
the command line tools, `mbed-cli`. Arm developed `mbed-cli` to manage the
development of [Mbed OS](https://www.mbed.com/en/platform/mbed-os/). 
Arm provides information about `mbed-cli` at
[Arm Mbed CLI](https://os.mbed.com/docs/v5.9/tools/arm-mbed-cli.html). 
The guidance below summarises the instructions for installation and use
on Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop, using the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain.

1. Before proceeding, it's sensible to make sure that your Ubuntu environment
   is up-to-date.

   ```sh
   $ sudo apt update
   $ sudo apt upgrade
   ```
   We are assuming that you are working on a machine where the 
   GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain and `pyocd` have been installed, as 
   described in [lab 1](L01.html). If that is not the case, you should go
   back to [lab 1](L01.html) and follow those instructions before continuing
   here.

1. You should already have `python 2.7` and `pip` installed on your system.
   You can check for `python 2.7` with

     ```sh
     $ python --version
     ```
   You should see a version number, starting with `2.7`.

   Assuming you have `python`, you can check for `pip` with

     ```sh
     $ pip --version
     ```
   If you don't have `python 2.7`, I suggest you download 
   [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) and follow
   the [installation instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux).
   If you already have `python 2.7` but not `pip`, you can install
   it as follows:

     ```sh
     $ sudo apt-get install python-pip
     ```

1. Now install `mbed-cli`

     ```sh
     $ sudo pip install mbed-cli
     ```

1. Configure a global path setting to the compiler tools.

     ```sh
     $ mbed config -G GCC_ARM_PATH ~/.local/packages/gcc-arm/bin
     ```

1. You need to have the version control systems `git` and `hg` installed.
   You can check for them like this...

     ```sh
     $ git --version
     $ hg --version
     ```
   If you need to install `git`, do this

     ```sh
     $ sudo apt-get install git
     ```
   and if you need `hg` (mercurial), do this

     ```sh
     $ sudo apt-get install mercurial
     ```
1. Test your installation by cloning the `blinky-mbed` repository and
   building and running the program. Plug your board into your computer,
   ensuring that it is properly mounted, and then execute the following commands.
   **Note:** There may be a delay of a minute or two after the `mbed deploy` 
   command while some required libraries are downloaded.

     ```sh
     $ git clone https://github.com/davidkendall/blinky-mbed
     $ cd blinky-mbed
     $ mbed deploy
     $ mbed compile -t GCC_ARM -m K64F -f
     ```

   After a few seconds, you should see the red LED flashing on your K64F board.

   The options to the `mbed compile` command have the following meanings:

   *Option*     | *Meaning*
   `-t GCC_ARM` | use the GCC_ARM cross compiling tools
   `-m K64F`    | build for the K64F microprocessor
   `-f`         | load the executable file to flash

## Exercises

The application board has these components:

* A 128x32 graphics LCD 
* 3-axis accelerometer
* Temperature sensor
* 5-way joystick
* 2 x Potentiometers
* RGB LED
* Speaker
* Xbee socket

The details of pin configurations are shown in the `Details` section of
the [application board documentation](https://os.mbed.com/components/mbed-Application-Shield/).
This information will be helpful for programming the 5-way joystick, the 
potentiometers, the RGB LED, and the speaker. You will need to download libraries
to use the 128x32 LCD, the accelerometer, and the temperature sensor. How
to obtain these libraries will be explained later.

The aim of these exercises is to ensure that you can use all of these components
(except the Xbee socket) and to build a simple but complete test program for 
the application board.

1. **DigitalOut - RGB LED** <br/>
   As a first exercise with the application board, modify the code in
   the `main.cpp` file in the `src` directory of the `blinky-mbed` repository
   so that the red LED on the K64F board continues to flash, the red LED
   on the application board is turned off, and the green LED on the 
   application board flashes at the same rate as the red LED on the K64F
   board.

1. **DigitalOut - LCD, AnalogIn - potentiometers** <br/>
   To use the LCD you need to add the LCD library
   `C12832` to your project as follows:

   ```sh
   $ mbed add https://os.mbed.com/users/chris/code/C12832/
   ```

   A simple example of using the LCD is

   ```c
   #include "mbed.h"
   #include "C12832.h"
   #include <stdio.h>

   /* Pin configuration for FRDM-K64F */
   C12832 lcd(D11, D13, D12, D7, D10);

   int main() {
       lcd.cls();
       lcd.locate(0,0);
       lcd.printf("Hello world!\n");

       while (true) {
       }
   }
   ```
   Refer to the [128x32 Graphics LCD API](lcd.html) for information about
   the main methods availabe for use with the display.

   The potentiometers are analog inputs. Refer to the
   [Analogin API](https://os.mbed.com/handbook/AnalogIn) for information
   about how to use an analog input in `mbed`.

   Now modify your first program (`RGB LED`) so that it also displays the values 
   of the potentiometers on the LCD. The values should be displayed as
   numbers in the range [0,1] to 2 decimal places. Construct the program using
   a *super-loop* approach, i.e. as a single loop in which you sample the
   inputs at the top, and then calculate and apply the outputs.
   
1. **DigitalIn - joystick** <br/>
   The joystick gives you 5 digital inputs. Continue to add to your program so
   that your display has an extra line that shows the status of the joystick as
   one of: 

   *Status*  | *Symbol*
   Unpressed | -
   Up        | U
   Down      | D
   Left      | L
   Right     | R
   Centre    | C

   Continue with the super-loop architecture: read, compute, write, repeat,...

1. **AnalogIn - accelerometer** <br/>
   The 3-axis accelerometer provides 3 analog inputs for the X, Y, and Z
   axes. To use the accelerometer you need to add the library `MMA7660` to
   your project, as follows:

   ```sh
   $ mbed add https://os.mbed.com/users/Sissors/code/MMA7660/
   ```
   You should refer to the [MMA7660 API documentation](https://os.mbed.com/users/Sissors/code/MMA7660/docs/36a163511e34/classMMA7660.html)
   for information about the interface to the accelerometer. You'll
   also need to refer to the `Details` section of the
   [application board documentation](https://os.mbed.com/components/mbed-Application-Shield/)
   and the [FRDM-K64F documentation]() to figure out what are the correct
   pins for the I2C SDA (serial data) and SCL (serial clock) lines. When you
   have figured out these details, continue to add 
   to your program so that it displays values of the X, Y, and Z axes as
   numbers in the range [-1.5, +1.5] to 2 decimal places.

1. **AnalogIn - temperature sensor** <br/>
   Similarly, the temperature sensor provides an analog input. Again, you need
   to add a libary to your project to use it.

   ```sh
   $ mbed add https://os.mbed.com/users/chris/code/LM75B/
   ```
   The API for the library is very simple. Read the 
   [documentation](https://os.mbed.com/users/chris/code/LM75B/docs/6a70c9303bbe/classLM75B.html).
   Now extend your program to add the temperature to the display. You can assume
   that the range is roughly [-15,+50]. Again, display the value to 2 decimal
   places.

1. **DigitalOut (PWM) - speaker** <br/>
   The speaker is connected to a digital output pin. This pin can be controlled 
   in the standard way or by using *pulse width modulation* (PWM). Read section
   10.1.1 in [Lee and Seshia](http://localhost:4000/kf6010/assets/ra/LeeSeshia_DigitalV2_2.pdf)
   for a short introduction to PWM. Mbed provides a 
   [simple API for PWM](https://os.mbed.com/handbook/PwmOut). 

   Now extend your program so that the speaker is controlled by PWM and uses
   the left button on the FRDM-K64F board to turn the speaker on and off.  When
   the button is pressed, the speaker should make a tone that is roughly A440.
   When the button is released the speaker should be off. There's no need to do
   anything fancy here. Just use a duty cycle of 50% (on) or 0% (off) and an
   appropriate period for the PWM.

## Working at home

You'll need to spend about 5 or 6 hours per week, outside of scheduled
classroom time, working on the exercises and doing further reading. The most
important part of this will be the time that you spend programming. You can
configure your own computer to enable you to do any of the work that you would
normally do in the lab. If your own computer has a Linux OS installed, then you
can simply follow the instructions for installing the GNU Arm Embedded
Toolchain and pyOCD.  If you have a Windows or Mac machine, then you should
[install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html) and create an
Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop guest OS to run on your machine. See [Using
Virtualbox](http://hesabu.net/kf4005/L01.html#using-virtualbox) for guidance.
You can then install the tools, as explained earlier.
